\subsection{Raja Kantheti}
I am a master's student in Computer Science at UCCS. I want to choose the thesis path to satisfy the degree requirements. My expected course outcomes are to learn what it means to conduct research, how to write scientific papers, better articulate my ideas and evaluate their novelty, and write at least one paper of any type by the end of the semester.

I want to do my thesis on processor pipeline design, which would optimize branch prediction using additional prefetching and decoding units in parallel with the central decode unit. This pipeline could also mitigate SPECTRE attacks, which exploit Speculative execution. 

I am determined to evaluate my thesis proposal, understand the necessary steps to evaluate the outcomes of my thesis, and grasp the elements of a successful proposal. I am also excited to challenge myself, to see if I have the stamina for long-term research and if this path is the right one for my career progression.

Some personal things about me outside of academia are that I like to be in solitude from time to time, lost in my thoughts and devices, contemplating meta-ethics, talking and debating with myself, and exploring all possibilities. The routines that would allow me to do this are my hobbies: Long walks and longer drives, camping alone, hiking in state/national parks and, wood carving.

\section*{Output of the gem5 simulator: Running a test program: }
gem5 is a cycle accurate simulator widely used in Computer Architecture Research. 
It is used to simulate the behavior of a computer system. 
The output of the gem5 simulator is a trace of the instructions executed by the processor. 
The trace is a list of instructions executed by the processor, along with the cycle number at which the instruction was executed.
The trace can be used to analyze the performance of the processor, and to identify bottlenecks in the processor design.

The simulation will produce a file with numerous metrics below are some of the metrics used by me for the survey paper.\\
This is a simulation for risc-v ISA on a MINOR CPU for a  likedlist program.

\section*{Questions For me: }
Your work looks interesting from a computer architecture perspective. However, you have mentioned that it is based on risc-v architecture, in the current context, how is the scenario of this architecture being used in real world applications? What do you see the future prospects of it?
How do you think self reflection has helped you in designing your thesis? DC.
