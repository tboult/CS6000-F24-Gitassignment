\maketitle

\section*{Neeta Kannu}
Hello! My name is Neeta, and I am an international student, currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at UCCS. With a few years of experience as a software engineer, I am working on various projects aligned with my research interests.

\subsection*{Current Projects}
I am currently exploring large language models (LLMs) in bioinformatics and conducting a survey related to this topic.

\subsection*{Research Repository}
I am working with the following Git repository for my research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GitHub Link: \url{https://github.com/ncbi/GeneGPT}
\end{itemize}

I have cloned this repository to my local machine and am actively working on it. 
I have obtained initial results from my first run and am now analyzing them.

\subsection*{Test Outputs}
Below is a screenshot of the output after setting up the environment and running GeneGPT on GeneTuring using the command:

python main.py 111111

Here, `111111` specifies that all Documentations (Dc.1-2) and Demonstrations (Dm.1-4) are used.

Below is the screenshot from my first run:

\subsection*{Experience}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I have started working on the project with the goal of achieving meaningful results that will inform my next steps. However, there are moments when I feel stuck, which makes me realize the need to delve deeper into the material.
    
    \item The training process is time-consuming, and I am working on optimizing the workflow to reduce the time required for execution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Questions and Answers}
% Please feel free to ask any questions, I will try to answer.

\textbf{Q: What is one trait of you that has really influenced you this semester? -- Abdul} \\
\textbf{A:} One trait that significantly influenced me this semester was inspired by Dr. Boult's commitment to teaching high-quality material and his unwavering support for students. His approach motivated me to stay consistent and persevere through challenges. Balancing coursework, research, and personal life was indeed exhausting, but taking short breaks and returning to work with a fresh perspective helped me manage my responsibilities more effectively.\\

\textbf{Q: What type of CPU or GPU are you using for training? -- Danny Cruz} \\
\textbf{A:} I am not using any GPUs for training; instead, I run the model entirely on my CPU. To accommodate hardware limitations, I work with a smaller, simplified version of the full model, which performs efficiently without any issues.
